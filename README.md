# COVID-19-EDA-and-Predictive-Analysis

Project Description

You are required to download relevant datasets associated with Covid 19 pan-
demic and make your model. Yours data set must include India data, any Two

States of India and also any two other country data.
1. Predictive: Use any Machine Learning Method, discussed in this course to
make model on COvid19 Data Set. Do the prediction of Covid19 Spread.
2. Exploratory: When your model is suggesting that Peak of Pandemic will
occurred and When, as per your model, it will be finished. Also, you may
do any other analysis.
Notes
1. Implementation has to be strictly in Python using appropriate libraries as
and when required

1

2. Conduct your analysis on at least two datasets. One of the datasets has
to be necessarily from India (either country data or data coming from a
particular state)
Dataset Sources
1. You may download the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/tags/covid19).
2. Alternatively, you may also consider web scraping the data available with
the Government sources.

Abstract
The current research proposes a model to predict the number of people that may be affected, the peak period and the halt time for the coronavirus pandemic outbreak worldwide. Here, we apply Machine learning models to predict aforementioned predictions. We use the statistical data generated from countries, namely India, Spain and South Korea and we also use the statistical data from some of the Indian states for prediction purposes in order to get some meaningful insights from our analysis.

Introduction
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.
